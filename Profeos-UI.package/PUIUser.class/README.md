I represent a user of the system.

An arbitrary number of users will be created in our application 
and saved in the database later on. Users will be identified in 
distinct sessions after the log in process. Based on the user's 
session, all further data, their tasks for instance, will be found, 
so that only their owner can manage them. The following class 
definition shows the StUser class with its instance variables 
required for identification, authentication, registration and 
application-specific properties.
